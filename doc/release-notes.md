Bitcoin Knots version *0.16.1.knots20180713* is now available from:

  <https://bitcoinknots.org/files/0.16.x/0.16.1.knots20180713/>

This is a new minor version release, including new features, various bugfixes
and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/issues>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Downgrading warning
-------------------

Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16
and will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing
wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Knots is supported on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel,
macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Bitcoin Knots should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

RPC changes
-----------

### RPC method whitelists

RPC method whitelists have been added to help enforce application policies for
services being built on top of Bitcoin Knots (e.g., your Lightning Node maybe
shouldn't be adding new peers). The aim of this feature is not to make it
advisable to connect your Bitcoin node to arbitrary services, but to reduce
risk and prevent unintended access.

### Removal of premature PSBT support

BIP 174 has been modified, making it incompatible with the premature PSBT
support in v0.16.0. The new PSBT code is too invasive to backport, so the PSBT
RPC methods have simply been removed for now.

### Low-level changes

- JSON transaction decomposition now includes a `weight` field which provides
  the transaction's exact weight. This is included in REST /rest/tx/ and
  /rest/block/ endpoints when in json mode. This is also included in `getblock`
  (with verbosity=2), `listsinceblock`, `listtransactions`, and
  `getrawtransaction` RPC commands.
- JSON mempool entry descriptions now include the `bip125-replaceable` field,
  showing if enabling the replace-by-fee feature is requested for them.
- When known, `signrawtransaction` may now include fee information. (Note that
  sometimes it is not known.)
- New setscriptthreadsenabled/scriptthreadsinfo methods have been added to
  give more control over block verification threads.
- A new submitheader method allows submitting block headers without their
  new transactions.
